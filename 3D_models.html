            <!-- Description -->
            <p>
                I am currently working on hosting the line of 3D model NFTs I built for my Dad on this website.
                He is an architect who specializes in designing large buildings. For every building he designs,
                he creates a physical model and a 2D representation. As a present to him, I decided to replicate
                his work in another medium using Blender's 3D modeling software.
            </p>
            <p>
                These digital 3D models capture the essence of his architectural designs and provide a unique,
                modern way to showcase his creative vision. The goal is to make these models available as NFTs,
                combining art, architecture, and technology into a new collectible format.
            </p>
