If the course does not load and is stuck on this page:
 -Click in the middle of the page
 -Press the question mark key (?) three times
 -A window should pop up containing debug information, send this information to technical support for further assistance
 -If no information appears, try again 1 or 2 more times, sometimes that just does the trick
