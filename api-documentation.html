        <h2>API Revamp for Renewable Energy Data Submission</h2>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>
            This project addressed challenges faced by renewable energy plants in New England, where approximately 30% of facilities struggled to utilize a Java-based API for submitting required data.
            By transitioning to Python, creating a complete API template, and designing an intuitive GUI, this project significantly improved API usability and compliance rates.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Contributions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Transition from Java to Python:</strong> Rewrote the API's core functionality in Python to make the codebase more approachable and user-friendly.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Complete API Template:</strong> Developed a Python-based template with pre-built functions for all possible API operations, providing ready-to-use examples and eliminating user ambiguity.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Comprehensive Documentation:</strong> Authored a 30-page guide explaining every aspect of the API, including setup instructions, usage examples, and advanced workflows. The documentation will be linked directly in this portfolio.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI):</strong> Designed a GUI to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Visualize how API outputs feed into subsequent API calls.</li>
                    <li>Explain the general flow of interacting with the API.</li>
                    <li>Make complex data workflows accessible to non-technical users.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Improved Usability:</strong> Streamlined the onboarding process for energy plants, reducing setup time and enhancing system reliability with fully tested functionalities.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Technical Details</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Python Code:</strong> Modularized Python scripts for API interactions, data handling, and debugging.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>GUI Integration:</strong> Implemented using frameworks like Tkinter to provide an interactive and intuitive user experience.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tools Used:</strong> Python, Pandas, and other libraries for data handling and API workflows.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Output:</strong> Delivered a robust Python API template, a user-friendly GUI, and detailed documentation.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>
            This project ensured that renewable energy plants in New England could efficiently submit their data with minimal setup and learning time.
            The revamped API, intuitive GUI, and comprehensive documentation collectively improved compliance rates, system reliability, and user experience.
