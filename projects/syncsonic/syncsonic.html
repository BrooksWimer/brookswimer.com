								<h2>Project Overview</h2>
								<p>SyncSonic is a custom-built, low-latency audio distribution system for Raspberry Pi that allows any smartphone to become a powerful multi-speaker controller. It uses a combination of Linux audio tools (PulseAudio), the BlueZ Bluetooth stack, and a custom BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) service to connect and control a fleet of Bluetooth speakers in real time.</p>

							<section class="feature-section">
								<h2>How It Works</h2>
								<p>SyncSonic is deployed on a Raspberry Pi connected to multiple USB Bluetooth adapters. The backend service is written entirely in Python and coordinates all device activity through a finely tuned architecture:</p>
								<ul class="feature-list">
									<li><strong>Custom BLE GATT Protocol:</strong> The Pi advertises a BLE characteristic that enables a mobile app to send JSON-encoded commands (e.g., connect/disconnect, set volume, mute, scan for devices). All communication is handled through a single R/W/Notify GATT characteristic.</li>
									<li><strong>State Machine for Each Speaker:</strong> Each Bluetooth speaker follows a deterministic FSM to ensure proper sequencing of discovery, pairing, trust, connection, and audio loopback setup. The system supports real-time reconnection and handles transient failures automatically.</li>
									<li><strong>PulseAudio Loopbacks:</strong> A central virtual_out sink is created on the Pi, and audio is looped to each speaker's sink using per-device module-loopback instances, with adjustable latency and volume.</li>
									<li><strong>BLE Notifications:</strong> Live status updates are pushed from the Pi to the mobile app using BLE notifications, keeping the user informed of connection phases and results.</li>
								</ul>
							</section>

							<section class="feature-section">
								<h2>Mobile App Integration</h2>
								<p>The mobile application connects to the Pi over BLE and allows users to:</p>
								<ul class="feature-list">
									<li>Scan and Select Speakers: Dynamically detect available Bluetooth devices and initiate connections</li>
									<li>Group Speakers: Create and manage audio groups for synchronized playback</li>
									<li>Adjust Audio Settings: Fine-tune latency, master volume, and left/right balance for each speaker</li>
									<li>Mute and Unmute: Toggle mute state on a per-device basis</li>
								</ul>
							</section>

							<section class="feature-section">
								<h2>Frontend Architecture</h2>
								<p>The SyncSonic mobile application is built using React Native with Expo, featuring a modern, responsive UI that adapts to both light and dark themes. The frontend is designed with a focus on user experience and real-time device management.</p>

								<h2>System Highlights</h2>
								<ul class="feature-list">
									<li><strong>Multi-Adapter Management:</strong> Utilizes USB Bluetooth dongles in parallel, with one reserved for BLE communication and others for audio streaming</li>
									<li><strong>Thread-Safe and Modular:</strong> Discovery, connection orchestration, and D-Bus operations are managed through synchronized worker queues</li>
									<li><strong>Resilient Startup and Operation:</strong> Designed for hands-free operation via systemd with automatic environment initialization</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Current Status</h2>
								<p>The prototype successfully streams synchronized audio to up to four Bluetooth speakers from any brand, with live control via the mobile app. It has been tested with real-time audio sources like Spotify and local media.</p>
							</section>

							<section class="feature-section">
								<h2>Next Steps</h2>
								<p>The current prototype proves that seamless, synchronized Bluetooth audio playback is possible using commodity hardware. The next phase of the project is to transition from the Raspberry Pi to a custom hardware platform designed specifically for this use case. I am actively seeking funding to develop a compact, cost-effective board that integrates a Linux-capable processor with multiple directly wired Bluetooth chips—eliminating the need for USB dongles and reducing latency, power consumption, and physical complexity.</p>
								<p>This purpose-built device will serve as a plug-and-play Bluetooth audio hub, enabling consumer-friendly deployment in homes, outdoor events, shared spaces, and more. The mobile app and backend software are already production-ready and will be fully compatible with the new hardware. With funding, I aim to take SyncSonic from prototype to polished product.</p>
