        <h2 class="major">ENS and CAMS Automation</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            This project showcases my ability to automate large-scale data synchronization tasks between two critical systems:
            the Emergency Notification System (ENS) and the Company Asset Management System (CAMS). The goal was to ensure
            data consistency, reduce manual intervention, and improve overall system reliability. The automation handles
            tasks such as data fetching, comparison, updating, and reporting with detailed error handling.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Automation with Selenium:</strong> Designed scripts to interact with the ENS interface for retrieving,
                updating, and managing data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data Reconciliation:</strong> Compared datasets from CAMS and ENS to identify discrepancies, using
                pandas for efficient data manipulation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Dynamic Reporting:</strong> Generated detailed reports of updates, discrepancies, and records flagged
                for manual review, shared via automated emails.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Error Handling:</strong> Implemented robust mechanisms to log and recover from failures during web
                interactions or data processing.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Technical Details</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Driver Initialization and Login:</strong> Used Selenium WebDriver to automate the login process for
                ENS with secure error handling.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data Processing:</strong> Collected and filtered data from ENS and CAMS using pandas. Identified
                unique records and performed in-depth comparisons between datasets to find mismatches.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>ENS Updates:</strong> Automated updates to ENS records to match CAMS data, including additions,
                modifications, and deletions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Reporting and Communication:</strong> Created CSV reports highlighting changes made, discrepancies
                found, and records requiring manual intervention. Sent reports automatically via email for stakeholder review.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Monthly vs. Daily Updates</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Monthly Update:</strong> Comprehensive reconciliation of all ENS data against CAMS to ensure full alignment.<br>
        </p>
        <span class="image main"><img src="images/ENS_weekly_gliffy.png" alt="" /></span>
        <p>
            <strong>Daily Update:</strong> Incremental updates to reflect daily changes in CAMS, ensuring ENS remains up-to-date.
        </p>
